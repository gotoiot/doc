# Hello IoT Documentation

[Leer en espa√±ol](./README.md)

The purpose of this repository is to centralize in a unique place all the documentation for the projects within the [Goto IoT](https://github.com/gotoiot) organization.

To make this documentation easy to navigate and understand, we created the [Central Wiki](https://github.com/gotoiot/doc/wiki), which is the unique place necessary to explore for use the projects.

Each project has its own README with brief information about the context, dependencies installation and execution; but in the [Central Wiki](https://github.com/gotoiot/doc/wiki) there is more comprehensive and organized information, so we strongly recommend using this medium as an information method.

# Hello IoT Documentation

[Leer en espa√±ol](README-ES.md)

The purpose of this repository is to centralize in a single place all the documentation corresponding to the projects within the organization [Hello IoT](https://github.com/hello-iot).

To make the use of the documentation easy to navigate and understand, we created a Wiki at [this link](https://github.com/hello-iot/documentation/wiki), which is the only place to explore to use the projects.

Each project has its own README with brief information about the context, dependencies installation and execution; but in the [Central Wiki](https://github.com/hello-iot/documentation/wiki) there is more comprehensive and organized information, so we strongly recommend using this medium as an information method.
